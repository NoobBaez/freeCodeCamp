                        explained. The host of the programme, Esther Rantzen, asked whether anybody in the audience owed
                        their lives to Winton, and if so, to stand: more than two dozen people surrounding Winton rose
                        and applauded. Ms Rantzen then asked if anyone present was the child or grandchild of one of the
                        children Winton saved. The rest of the audience stood.</p>
